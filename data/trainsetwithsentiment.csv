Healthcare systems need to be designed to look at multiple LTC and co-morbidities. In 5-10 years time care planning and personalised care would work in primary care integrated across primary, secondary and community and voluntary sectors. It would provide HCP’s with the best set of optimal choices to recommend to their patients as part of treatment pathway and those treatment pathways would combine medication, statutory services, educational resources, goals habits and actions for patients with multiple long term conditions. The pathways would be informed by the AI big data learning for what has worked for similar patients looking through the lens of ethnicity, deprivation and different combinations of LTC.","Efficiency, insights and prevention",0.943

"1670","Google Form Spillover","All","A healthy technology industry is made up of firms which are laser-focussed on the needs of their users and of solving their problems with software. This depends on close working in partnership with those users themselves, to develop, launch and iterate on products that address those needs.

Because of the current conditions in healthcare technology today, efforts made by companies are too often focused elsewhere. The danger is it’s too easy to succeed by becoming great at delivering pitches to central bodies and commissioners, rather than building software loved by your users. Users needs are too often forgotten in these processes, losing out to points about central reporting. Fundamentally, if it makes your job quicker, easier, or makes you more effective at working as a team, that should win the day. The more we let users try software and choose it, the better chance we’ll have of industry building solutions that meet their needs. 

The principle we follow at accuRx - and which we believe applies well to the Plan - is the principle to ‘let users be choosers’. We’ve written about this before, but this essentially means making sure the end users of software have a choice about which software they use, and ensure that funding flows to that software’s maker. 

The centre (NHS England) needs to avoid dictating specifications of tech to be used by frontline staff or patients, and sewing up procurements with a single or handful of suppliers without meaningfully testing others’ ability to deliver a solution. 

To borrow language from the last health tech plan launched when NHS X was created, this might work best when applied to the ‘Application layer’, rather than the ‘Data layer’, which will inevitably need more central governance and control. Communications solutions are part of the Application Layer, though of course they depend on open integrations with the Data Layer.

But where it can, the centre needs to create frameworks with some key, core capabilities focused on problems to be solved (like communication with or about patients). Instead, we'd advise that developers are trusted to create the best solutions - with individual users making the choice about what app they use where possible.","Working with industry",0.995
