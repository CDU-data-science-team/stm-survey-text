"29","sp","Staff","Professionalism/Competence Of Staff","A lot. Our baby girl was born 6 weeks premature, mid 2019. She had a 8 - 12 month assessment form filled by myself. In [Redacted for data protection], it was given to the home visitor on [Redacted for data protection]. Due to my girl not having stood up supported by that time, and also COVID preventing the home visitor doing a height measurement and head measurement, they told us that they would return in [Redacted for data protection] to check on the gross motor skills and to do a full height measurement etc.  We then had a second visit week commencing [Redacted for data protection], my baby girl was standing up at the sofa on her own and was weighed and measured.  The same home visitor as before then asked if I had filled in the assessment form and I told her we had given it to her on her last visit.  The very next thing she said was the form we were given was incorrect it was for a full term baby and we should have been given a premature baby assessment form, therefore, my baby was on target for her adjusted age and doing fine in all areas and so this second meeting was not required.  How can someone question whether we had filled in a form and then say in the next breath, the form filled in was for full term babies? My assumption here is the form has gone missing!!  I then asked whether there would be any further assessments and she told me no not until the baby is 2 years old.  Fast forward to [Redacted for data protection] - now had another letter requesting a growth review!!! The NHS website states that these weight checks etc should be carried out NO MORE than every 3 months and that once the 1 year assessment is complete the next one is at 2 years old.  We have had 3 in 3 months!!  I point blank refuse to go to this one and will not be going to anymore until my baby is 2 years old, it is taking time out of mine or my husbands work for each one of these assessments, we have now been lied to, more than once. If my baby girl is not on track for her growth why are we not being told at the assessment?  According to her red book, all her measurements are fine or are we being lied to again? If a further assessment is required I want a full reason as to why, I want an explanation on why we haven't been told at past assessments. I also want compensation for loss of earnings for every future assessment before 2 years old, we have to attend whilst in working hours! Get it sorted!",-4,"Trust A","Trust A - Q1",30,-0.873

I was referred 18 months ago and, apart from my initial assessment, have yet to have any treatment. Communication is often contradictory, phone calls are not returned, staff do not introduce themselves and I am made to feel like a problem, when I try to clarify what is happening. Promises of treatment are made regularly but never fulfilled. During this telephone call I was told that the doctor was going to chase up my treatment, but that she thought it best to discharge me 'in the hope' that the Stabilisation clinic would pick me up. She warned me that I may get lost in the system though. As my symptoms and mental health has worsened in the last three months to the point where I was considering self harm I asked if I should increase my medication (Fluoxetine) but the doctor suggested this was only a 'last resort' and that I should use Diazepam instead. She said if I couldn't get enough from my GP I could come to the Hope Centre for more. The phone call ended with the doctor assuring me that I wouldn't need to do anything, she would put into action the points raised. However, when I received the follow up letter a few days later it says that I am to call the Hope Centre in one month if I haven't had any further contact. Not only is that contradictory, but it puts pressure on me - the one suffering with PTSD, issues with trust, disorientation and disassociation - to make sure I don't fall out of the system.",-4,"Trust A","Trust A - Q1",225,0.637

Try having my flashbacks, an hearing the voices from them situations, and being physically unable to move, just curled up in bed shivering and crying from my flashbacks.

"656","dp","Dignity","Involvement: Of Service Users/Patients","So let down. I understand the pandemic has disrupted services but this shouldn't alter the amount of group therapy given. Using the pandemic as an excuse to cut out months at the end of my group therapy because you thought I needed support then rather than later, is unacceptable. I wasn't given the option to make the decision for myself in my care. I had no choice I had to take the phone calls. If I had the choice I would've waited for group therapy to start rather than having to take one to one phone calls, as part of my group therapy time scale. If I was told that those phone calls would be taken off the end of my group therapy, and if I was given the choice I would've waited for group to start. Those phone calls really should've been classed as support calls rather than group MBT. I have waited years for this personalised therapy, I only get one chance in my lifetime to access it. Yet you have cut my time short by months. I now have to sit in group therapy listening to my therapist say to the new starters that they will have a ""full year of group therapy to explore their difficulties."" Hearing those words was like a dagger to my heart. You chose to end my therapy on fri 13th, the most unlucky day of the year. Also 3 days before my birthday. I also found out that I'm the first person to leave the group even though we all started together. Do you know how that all feels? Obviously no, thought has gone in to thinking about the individual, me. How all this would make me feel. I was also told I was going to get an Autism assessment. I've not heard anything so I guess this is no longer going ahead. I was told this assessment would help see if I have Autism or other mental health disorders, as it is looking like I have more than BPD. Now I feel all this research has stopped because of how soon you are making me leave, as there is not enough time now. I had high hopes for getting the treatment time needed but you didn't give it me. You can't alter treatment because of a pandemic especially when this treatment is a one off access.

"657","sp","Staff","Professionalism/Competence Of Staff","The therapist was often very late to sessions, I would commonly be waiting 15-30 minutes for him to call me. On other occasions we would have a call scheduled in and I would be waiting but the call would never come. I would then hear nothing until the following week when our next appointment was due and he would behave as if nothing had happened. During the sessions the therapist often talked over me, he would ask me a question and then go off on a tangent and not allow me to get a word in. One of the main issues I had was that he didn't take my opinions into account, particularly concerning my ongoing treatment. I felt I was not ready to be discharged from the service but there was a continual pressure for me to do so. The therapist kept bringing this up in our sessions and eventually texted me to tell me that I was being discharged from the service despite my wishes. In the message he explained the reason for this being that he was under pressure from management due to an extensive waiting list, I feel this is an unacceptable reason to discharge someone still in need of support. Over all I feel the lack of care and poor communication has really affected my experience and that the delivery of this type of service should be monitored more closely. I still feel that I am struggling with issues I really need support with.

Graham has equally been of a great support to me in helping me back to work, virtually attending work welfare meetings and making suggestions on how my work place could support me with my disability. and giving much me advice support and encouragement.

She was very empathic to my emotions during the call. It was a full hour I think, and felt like a long time, in a good way - there was lots of time to go into detail and explain what I meant about my answers. When we discussed treatments, Katie was very receptive to my desire to have counselling, over CBT, as I had tried that a couple of years ago (through yourselves), and found it didn't quite work for me, and in fact increased my anxiety at times. Katie also explained in regards to a new treatment - interpersonal psychotherapy - that might be appropriate for me. She said she would talk it through with her supervisor and get back to me the following Monday, which she did, and kindly offered me the counselling I had requested. At every stage, from booking the assessment to discussing the treatment which I am now on the waiting list for, I felt very well looked after, by a caring and efficient service. Thank you.

I have regularly received this type of treatment off doctors, I know they are busy, and they are good at what they do but seems that some doctors forget who they are talking to most of the time, which is sick and confused people. They do not seem to like it when patients know a lot about their conditions or us patients who like a proper in-depth explanation on everything that’s happening. But by them taking the extra 5-10 minutes explaining properly, can solve a lot of issues and confusion and lower our anxiety levels.
